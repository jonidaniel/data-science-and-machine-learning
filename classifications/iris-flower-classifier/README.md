# Iris Flower Classifier

An iris flower classifier implemented with two different algorithms: decision tree and k-nearest neighbors.

## Setup and testing

**On Mac:**

1. First, make sure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

2. Then, download the repository to your local machine by giving this command via your command line tools: `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/data-science-and-machine-learning`

3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd data-science-and-machine-learning/classifications/iris-flower-classifier`

4. Create a [Python virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for the project's Python dependencies with `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`

5. Activate the newly created venv with `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`

6. Install all needed Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

7. Open `/iris-flower1-data-analysis-and-exploration.ipynb` in your IDE and run it to form a data frame.

8. And finally in your IDE, open and run whichever algorithm you choose, `/iris-flower2-decision-tree-classifier.ipynb` or `iris-flower3-knn-classifier.ipynb`
