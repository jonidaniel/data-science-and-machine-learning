# Iris Flower Classifier

An iris flower classifier implemented with two different algorithms: decision tree and k-nearest neighbors.

## Setup and testing

**On Mac:**

1. First, make sure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

2. Then, download the repository to your local machine by giving this command via your command line tools: `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/data-science-and-machine-learning`

3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd data-science-and-machine-learning/classifications/iris-flower-classifier`

4. Create a [Python virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for the project's Python dependencies with `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`

5. Activate the newly created venv with `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`

6. Install all needed Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This command will install `ipykernel`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` packages to the project.

7. Open the whole project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended) with `code .` (different commands apply for different IDEs).

8. Run the cells on `iris-flower1-data-analysis-and-exploration.ipynb` to form a data frame. You must have a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) extension installed and your venv selected as the Python kernel.

9. And finally, run the cells on whichever algorithm you choose, `iris-flower2-decision-tree-classifier.ipynb` or `iris-flower3-knn-classifier.ipynb`
