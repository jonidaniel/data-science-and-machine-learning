# Regressions

Different solutions to linear regression, multiple regression, and polynomial regression problems.

## Setup and testing

**On Mac:**

1. First, make sure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

2. Then, download the repository to your local machine by commanding `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/data-science-and-machine-learning` in your command line tools.

3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd data-science-and-machine-learning/regressions`

4. Create a [Python virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for the project's Python dependencies with `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`

5. Activate the newly created venv with `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`

6. Install all needed Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This will install `ipykernel`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy` and `seaborn` packages to the project.

7. Run `code .` to open the whole project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended; different commands apply for different IDEs).

8. Run the cells on `linear-regression-salary.ipynb`, `linear-regression.ipynb`, `linear-regression3.ipynb`, `multiple-regression.ipynb`, or `polynomial-regression.ipynb`. You must have a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) extension installed and your venv selected as the Python kernel.
