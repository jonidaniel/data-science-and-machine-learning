## Setup and testing

1. First, make sure that you have `python3` and `pip3` installed.

2. Then, download this project to your local machine by giving this command via your command line tools: `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/machine-learning/tree/main/regressions`

3. Navigate to the project directory `regressions` and create a Python virtual environment (venv) for the project's Python dependencies with `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`

4. Activate the newly created venv with `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`

5. Install all needed Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

6. In your IDE, open whichever notebook you choose `/` and run it. You need to use the venv you created as your Python kernel.
