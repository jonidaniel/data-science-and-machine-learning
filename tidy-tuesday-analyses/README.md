# Tidy Tuesday Analyses

R data analyses on [Tidy Tuesday's](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) weekly data projects with differing datasets.

## Setup and Testing

**On macOS:**

1. First, make sure that you have `git` installed.

2. Then, download the repository to your local machine by commanding `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/data-science-and-machine-learning` in your command line tools.

3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd data-science-and-machine-learning/tidy-tuesday-analyses`

4. Every subdirectory name here is in format `YYYY_MM_DD_name_of_analysis`. Each subdirectory is devoted to that week's dataset analysis. Inside each subdirectory, you'll find three kinds of files:

   - `.R` files

     Contains the source R code. The most basic form of an analysis. Can be used as basis for more developed file types, like [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files. You can try out the code on your own if you have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and e.g., [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed.

   - `.Rmd` files

     Contains the R Markdown code used to build a web presentation of an analysis. In RStudio, you can try _knitting_ this file into an HTML file yourself.

   - `.html` files

     Formerly an R Markdown file. This is basically a ready-to-go HTML demonstration – the final product of an analysis. Open in a web browser.
