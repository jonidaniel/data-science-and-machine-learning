# Data Science Basics

Demonstrations on basic data science functions, data distribution and scatterplot.

## Setup and Testing

**On macOS:**

1. First, make sure that you have `git`, `python3` and `pip3` installed.

2. Then, download the repository to your local machine by commanding `git clone https://github.com/jonidaniel/data-science-and-machine-learning` in your command line tools.

3. Navigate to the project directory with `cd data-science-and-machine-learning/data-science-basics`

4. Create a [Python virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for the project's Python dependencies with `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`

5. Activate the newly created venv with `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`

6. Install all needed Python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` This will install `ipykernel`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy` packages to the project.

7. Run `code .` to open the whole project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended; different commands apply for different IDEs).

8. Finally, run the cells on whichever notebook(s) you like. You must have a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) extension installed and your venv selected as the Python kernel.

   - `basic-data-science-functions.ipynb`

     For demonstrating basic data science/machine learning functions (mean, median, mode, etc.)

   - `data-distribution-and-scatterplot.ipynb`

     For demonstrating uniform data distribution, normal data distribution, and scatterplot.
